This is a coding project for iTrellis.

Code was developed in Visual Studio 2019 for Mac. I ran into some knowledge gaps with rendering JSON in React that I will address shortly. As I determine solutions, I will make changes in a separate branch. The web project was created using the React.js template in Visual Studio which creates a basic frontend. For simplicity, it creates the API in the same project, something I would avoid for production code.
