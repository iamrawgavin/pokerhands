This is a coding project for iTrellis. 

Code was developed in Visual Studio 2019 for Mac. I ran into some knowledge gaps with rendering JSON in React that I will address shortly. As I determine solutions, I will make changes in a separate branch. The web project was created using the React.js template in Visual Studio which creates a basic frontend. For simplicity, it creates the API in the same project, something I would avoid for production code.

One should be able to simply clone this solution and run it locally. I am using a couple NuGet packages that might need to be restored. It doesn't require any external storage as the game data is dynamically generated each time. I went with the super clever naming convention of Player 1 and Player 2.
