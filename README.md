This is a coding project for iTrellis. 

Code was developed in Visual Studio 2019 for Mac. The web project was created using the React.js template in Visual Studio which creates a basic frontend. For simplicity, it creates the API in the same project, something I would avoid for production code.

One should be able to simply clone this solution and run it locally. I am using a couple NuGet packages that might need to be restored. It doesn't require any external storage as the game data is dynamically generated each time. I went with the super clever naming convention of Player 1 and Player 2.

Besides getting the frontend to properly display, if I had extra time, I would address the following (in no particular order): ability to assign names, tie breaker logic, reformatting.
